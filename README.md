## Description:
Simple analysis about MLB Free Agency from 1977 to 2020. Analysis includes data and plots describing how free agency has changed over time, looking at the total number of free agents, the percent of players resigned by their current team, and the percent of players that go unsigned each year. Analysis also looks at the same three variables broken up by team playoff success.

The file Free Agent Data Analysis.Rmd contains the code that produces the data and plots.
